# Application Rental System - Bug Fixes & Enhancements

## Summary
Fixed broken UI and implemented a comprehensive notifications system for the host dashboard, plus corrected the rent creation form to use real properties instead of dummy data. Also fixed the tenant registration flow to properly handle rent agreement creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Notifications System ✅

#### New Files Created:
- **`models/Notification.ts`** - Mongoose model for persisting in-app notifications
- **`components/host/NotificationPanel.tsx`** - UI component displaying notifications with read/unread status
- **`app/api/notifications/[id]/route.ts`** - API endpoint for marking individual or all notifications as read

#### Modified Files:
- **`app/api/notifications/route.ts`**
  - Updated GET handler to fetch real notifications from the database
  - Added filtering by userId, type, and unreadOnly
  - Returns notification list and unread count
  
- **`app/api/applications/route.ts`**
  - Persist in-app notification when application is submitted
  - Populate property and user fields in GET responses for proper display
  
- **`app/api/applications/[id]/[action]/route.ts`**
  - Create notifications for applicant when host accepts/rejects/requests info
  - Send WhatsApp/SMS notifications where possible

### 2. Host Dashboard Enhancements ✅

#### Modified: `app/host/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Added **Notifications tab** to the dashboard
- Integrated NotificationPanel component
- Added userId state and fetching to enable notifications
- Updated TabsList to support 6 tabs (Overview, Properties, Bookings, Rents, Applications, Notifications)
- Fixed responsive grid layout for tabs

#### Features:
- Real-time notification display
- Filter by unread/all notifications
- Mark individual notifications as read
- Mark all notifications as read at once
- Visual badges for unread count
- Click notification to navigate to relevant section

### 3. Rent Creation Form Fixes ✅

#### Modified: `app/host/rents/create/page.tsx`
- **Replaced dummy properties** with real API-fetched properties
- Added property fetching from `/api/host/properties`
- **Support for query parameter prefilling**:
  - `?propertyId=...` - prefills selected property
  - `?tenantEmail=...` - prefills tenant email
  - `?tenantName=...` - prefills tenant name
  - `?amount=...` - prefills rent amount
- Display property details in dropdown (title, city, price)
- Loading state while fetching properties
- Handle empty property list gracefully

### 4. Application Modal Enhancements ✅

#### Modified: `components/host/ApplicationModal.tsx`
- Already functional with Accept/Reject/Request Info actions
- Create Rent Agreement button creates rent programmatically
- Properly handles tenant creation or lookup
- Displays populated property and user data from API
- Enhanced error handling with detailed tenant ID extraction
- Added fallback phone number for tenant registration

### 5. Tenant Registration Fix ✅

#### Modified: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- **Added `skipPassword` parameter support** for programmatic tenant creation
- **Returns existing user** if email/phone already exists when `skipPassword=true`
- **Generates temporary password** for tenant accounts created without password
- **Returns user object without token** for tenant creation flow (no automatic login)
- Maintains backward compatibility with normal user registration

#### Impact:
- Fixes "Rent validation failed: tenant: Path `tenant` is required" error
- Enables seamless tenant account creation during rent agreement setup
- Allows hosts to create rent agreements for new or existing tenants
- Properly extracts tenant ID from multiple response formats

## API Endpoints

### Notifications
```
GET  /api/notifications?userId={id}&unreadOnly=true&type={type}
     Returns: { notifications: [], unreadCount: number }

PATCH /api/notifications/{id}
     Marks single notification as read

PUT  /api/notifications/mark-all-read
     Marks all user notifications as read
```

### Applications (Enhanced)
```
GET  /api/applications?host=true
     Returns applications with populated property & user fields
```

## Notification Types
- `application_submitted` - New application from tenant
- `application_accepted` - Host accepted application
- `application_rejected` - Host rejected application
- `application_more_info` - Host requested more info

## Testing Checklist

### Notifications
- [ ] Submit a rental application as a user
- [ ] Check host dashboard → Notifications tab shows new notification
- [ ] Unread badge displays correct count
- [ ] Click "Mark as read" on individual notification
- [ ] Click "Mark all read" button
- [ ] Filter by "Unread Only"
- [ ] Accept/reject application and check applicant receives notification

### Rent Creation
- [ ] Navigate to Host Dashboard → Create Rent Agreement
- [ ] Verify dropdown shows real properties (not dummies)
- [ ] Select property and verify details display correctly
- [ ] Use prefill link from Applications tab
- [ ] Verify tenant info auto-fills from query params
- [ ] Submit form and verify rent is created successfully
- [ ] Test with new tenant (should create user account)
- [ ] Test with existing tenant (should reuse existing account)

### Applications

## Notes

### Remaining Lint Warnings
- Two `<img>` tags in dashboard (lines 457, 673) should be converted to Next.js `<Image />` components for optimization
  - Low priority: doesn't affect functionality
  - Can be addressed in cleanup phase

### Type Safety
- All new components use proper TypeScript interfaces
- API responses properly typed where possible
- Notification model has strict schema

## Environment Variables Required
```env
# Optional: for WhatsApp/SMS notifications
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your_key
TWILIO_SID=your_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
```
